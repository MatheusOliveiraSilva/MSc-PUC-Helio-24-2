# helio-24-2
Repository intended for the work of the discipline "Computer Vision" taught by professor HÃ©lio in 2024.2

To test the program, simply install `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `python main.py`.

If it doesn't work right away, it may be because you don't have a camera with index=1, go to `utils/video_stream.py` and see what can be done (changing the index from 1 to 0 may help).

Any other bugs you want to resolve, that's the only compatibility issue.
